Understanding Web Applications and How They Work

1. What is a Web Application?

A website is essentially a web application installed on a server.
A server is a computer with specific programs (e.g., web server software) that make it accessible over the internet.
Servers are typically hosted on the cloud with public IPs, allowing users to interact with them online.

2. What is a Web Server?

A web server is a software that hosts and serves files (e.g., HTML, images) to users over the HTTP protocol.
It specifies a folder (web root) to store files that can be accessed remotely.
Web servers often contain web application files, and programs designed to run on the server and interact with users via the Internet.

3. Components of a Web Application

Web Server Files: Include static content like HTML, images, and stylesheets for website rendering.
Web Application Files: Contain dynamic code written in languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby to handle tasks like processing data.

4. Role of Databases

Database: Stores data (e.g., user accounts, product details) in organized tables.
Data is not stored in the web server or the application but in the database.
Example: A shop website's database table may contain product details such as IDs, names, and prices.

5. How Web Applications Work

Interaction with the Database:
Web applications communicate with databases to retrieve or process data.
Example: When a user logs in, the web application checks the username and password against the database.
Dynamic Content:
Web servers retrieve static files and dynamically process web application code to generate useful outputs like displaying product lists or user-specific content.

6. Summary of the Workflow

The user accesses the website via a browser.
The web server serves static files and processes web application code.
Web application interacts with the database to fetch and manipulate data.

Results are displayed to the user in an organized, visually appealing format.
