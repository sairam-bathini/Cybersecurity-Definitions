Understanding Buffer Overflow in Simple Terms
Imagine you are filling a glass with water. If you pour too much, the water overflows and spills onto the table. Now, think of a buffer in a computer program like that glass—it has a limited capacity. 
If you put more data into it than it can hold, the extra data overflows into other areas, potentially causing problems.

How Does This Happen in a Program?
A program often reserves a fixed amount of space in memory to store data, like a name or a password. If the program does not check how much data is being entered, an attacker can enter more data than expected, causing it to overflow into other memory areas.

Example in Real Life
Imagine you are writing a name on a form that has only 10 boxes for letters.
If your name is "Jonathan" (8 letters), it fits perfectly.
But if someone writes "Jonathan12345" (13 letters), the extra characters spill over into the next section of the form, possibly overwriting important information.

Why Is This Dangerous?

In computers, memory is used to store important information like passwords, return addresses, and system settings. If an attacker can overflow the memory, they might:
Crash the program – The extra data messes up how the program runs.
Change important information – Overwriting security settings or login credentials.
Take control of the computer – By injecting their own commands into the program’s memory, hackers can make it do whatever they want.

Real-World Example
Suppose a website asks for your username but does not check its length.
An attacker enters a very long name, which overflows into the website’s security system.
This can give them access to hidden administrator functions or even take control of the site!

1️⃣ Understanding How Memory Works in a Program
When a program runs, it stores data in memory. Each function has a reserved space in memory, including:

* Buffer (storage space for user input)
* Return address (where the program should go back after finishing a function)

If a program does not check input size, an attacker can enter more data than expected, overflowing into the return address, and changing the execution flow of the program.

2️⃣ How an Attacker Can Exploit This
Step 1: Find a Vulnerable Input Field
A website might have a login page with a field for a username:

c
Copy
Edit
char username[20];  // Buffer allocated only 20 bytes
gets(username);     // Takes input without size check (dangerous)
Here, gets(username); is unsafe because it doesn't limit how much data can be entered.

Step 2: Overflow the Buffer
Instead of entering a normal name like "John", an attacker enters a very long string (e.g., 100 characters).
This overwrites memory beyond the allocated space.
Step 3: Overwrite the Return Address
The return address tells the program where to go next.
By carefully crafting the input, an attacker can replace the return address with a location that executes their malicious code.
Step 4: Inject Malicious Code
The attacker can inject shellcode (malicious instructions) into memory and modify the return address to execute the shellcode instead of returning to the normal function.

Example: If the attacker wants to gain administrator privileges, they can craft an input that:

Overflows the buffer.
Replaces the return address with a function that grants admin access.
Redirects execution to the malicious code.
3️⃣ What Happens Next?
If the attack is successful, the attacker can: ✔ Gain admin access to the website
✔ Modify or delete data
✔ Execute commands on the server
✔ Steal sensitive information

4️⃣ Real-World Example
One famous example is the Morris Worm (1988), which used a buffer overflow in a Unix service (fingerd) to spread itself across the internet. More recently, buffer overflow attacks have been used in malware, ransomware, and remote code execution (RCE) attacks.

5️⃣ How to Prevent Buffer Overflow Attacks?
✅ Use safe functions like fgets() instead of gets() to limit input size.
✅ Enable memory protections like ASLR (randomizes memory locations) and DEP (prevents execution of injected code).
✅ Implement input validation to reject oversized input.
✅ Use modern security tools (e.g., Veracode, SonarQube) to detect vulnerabilities.

Final Thoughts
A buffer overflow attack works by tricking the program into executing malicious code by overflowing memory and modifying critical data. That’s why input validation, secure coding, and modern security defenses are crucial.
