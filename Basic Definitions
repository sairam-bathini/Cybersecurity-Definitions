Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM) – An attack where a third party intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties.

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack – An attack that overloads a system or network, making it unavailable to users.

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack – A more powerful form of DoS attack, where multiple systems flood a target, causing service disruption.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – A system that monitors network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) – A system that detects and prevents unauthorized access to a network or system.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) – A secure network connection over the internet that encrypts data and hides the user's IP address.

Penetration Testing – Simulated cyberattacks to identify and fix vulnerabilities in a system before an attacker can exploit them.

Vulnerability Assessment – The process of identifying, classifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system.

Incident Response – The approach taken to deal with security breaches, attacks, or other threats in real-time.

Forensics – The process of investigating and analyzing systems to gather evidence after a security incident.

Security Operations Center (SOC) – A centralized team that monitors and manages an organization’s security.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) – A system that collects, analyzes, and reports on security-related data across an organization.

Botnet – A group of compromised devices controlled by an attacker to perform malicious activities.

Brute Force Attack – An attack that uses trial and error to guess passwords or encryption keys.

SQL Injection – An attack that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's database layer by inserting malicious SQL queries.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – An attack that injects malicious scripts into web pages, which are executed by unsuspecting users' browsers.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) – An attack that tricks a user into performing actions they did not intend to perform by exploiting their authenticated session with a website.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) – A security feature that helps prevent XSS and other code injection attacks by specifying which sources are trusted for content on a web page.

Least Privilege – A principle that ensures users and systems are granted only the access necessary to perform their duties.

Data Breach – An incident where sensitive, protected, or confidential data is accessed, stolen, or disclosed without authorization.

Security Policies – A set of rules and practices that govern how an organization protects its information and IT systems.

Compliance – Adhering to industry standards, laws, and regulations related to data protection and cybersecurity.

Risk Assessment – The process of identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing risks to systems and data.

Patch Management – The process of updating software and systems to fix vulnerabilities and improve security.

Sandboxing – Isolating programs or code in a controlled environment to prevent them from affecting other parts of a system.

Data Loss Prevention (DLP) – A strategy for preventing unauthorized access to or transmission of sensitive data.

Zero Trust Architecture – A security model that assumes no one inside or outside a network can be trusted without verification.

API Security – Securing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to prevent unauthorized access or attacks.

Cryptography – The practice of securing communication and information using codes and encryption techniques.
