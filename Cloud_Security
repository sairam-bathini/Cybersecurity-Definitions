WHAT IS A CLOUD SECURITY
- shared responsibilty between you and the service provider

- PaaS
	- Making a program, migrating data and building applications
	- Responsible: workload, securing application and the data
	- Cloud provider: security of the application, the network, Runtime
	- Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software...

-IaaS
	- Infrastructure as a service
	-Adoption model
	- a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, 
	- including servers, storage, and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

- SaaS
	- Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications...
	

ARCHITECTURE
- DATA 
	-confidential data
	- public data
	- sensitive data 
	- Data must have at rest encryption - always data is encrypted
			- Data at rest
			- Data at motion
			- Data in storgae 
	- You own your data and have complete control
	- Private keys and public keys overall control over data stored based upon the nature of data present on your server 
	- You also have greater responsibilty with this model
	- Control over hardware module in which you have greater control over the encryption and decryption process
	- Holistic approach 
			- Bring your own keys
			- keep your own keys 
	- Data access is based upon the need
			- Limiting acccess to data
			- Application needs
			- User needs
	- Apllication Security
			- ensure the absence of application vunerabilities before releasing the application
			- Dynamic security
			- static security
	- Secure policy = control over data and clever oversight
	- User Access
			- who the user is : identity
			- what servers they are accessing 
			- Network access -> unauthorized users are blocked from acessing the data 
					- firewalls
					- network access control
					- DDOS protection
					- Intelligence built into the 	network
	- Continual surveillance 
		- Insight 
		- compliance
		- threats 
		- Identifying your posture
				-> Ability to gain visibility and be able to remediate and in order to maintain control at all times within the system, and take necessary action at all time

DEVOPS 
- DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATIONS 
- security a forethought instead of managing security  
Design
- secure design
- Integrating and embedding security as part of the process
Build 
- Security build 

Manage Security
- close loop
- remediate while recognizing threats
